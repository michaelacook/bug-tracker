# Bug Tracking Application
This project is an attempt to build a minimalistic but fully functional issue tracking application for use in design, software and production development and related teams.

## Running Locally 
Clone the project and run `npm run dev` to start Express and the React app. The React app uses a proxy to run on port 5000. To run the API only, run `npm run server`.
